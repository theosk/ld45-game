Story
-----
Centuries, the twelve elemental crystals were spread across the world. Their magic was meant to be used for the greater good.
Countless wars ensued, and most of them were destroyed. Today, two of them remain: the thunder crystal and the blood shard, and
two opposing factions fight for supremacy, sweeping most of the world in the process.
You were barely able to leave your hometown before it was destroyed. Without any luggage or goods, your boat heads to unknown lands,
hoping the war will not have arrived there.

First scene: Bandit shore
you wake up in the shore. You have nothing. You see a bandit attacking a merchant. Both are injuried. You will:
a) Hurry up and fight the bandit (get a dagger as a reward)
b) Let them kill each other and loot the corpses (get lots of money and a dagger)

You learn most of the guards have left to join the war. As a consequence, bandits and pirates roam freely.

The town is hiding a legendary treasure, and the pirates are after it.
